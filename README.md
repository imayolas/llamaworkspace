<h3 align="center"><strong>Host a ChatGPT Teams/Enterprise alternative on your infra</strong></h3>

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
[Joia](https://joia.so/) is an open source alternative to _[ChatGPT for Teams](https://openai.com/chatgpt/team)_, designed from the ground up for collaboration.

The easiest way to get started with Joia is by creating a [Joia Cloud account](https://joia.so/). If you prefer to self-host Joia, please refer to our documentation below.
=======
## The product

Llama Workspace is an open source ChatGPT Teams/Enterprise alternative.

Our goal is to create a single user interface to access all the company's AI. That's why we have created a product heavily inspired in the category-defining ChatGPT, but we have made it easy to connect with other AI products and tools.

It shines by being:

- **Teams first**: It comes with user management and granular permissions built-in.
- **Extensible**: Easily build AI chatbots and agents, and use Llama Workspace as the UI. That'll help you centralize all your AI products in a single place.
- **Straightforward to self-host**: Get up and running with a fewest possible number of commands.

## Getting started

#### Cloud

The easiest way to get started with Joia is with [our official managed service in the cloud](https://joia.so/). At the moment it is completely free to use without limits, although we have plans to introduce a pricing model in the future.

In the cloud version you can either use your own API keys for LLM provider, or purchase credits with us.

Our cloud version can save a substantial amount of developer time and resources. We think it's the de-facto solution for most customers and the one which provides most value for mone. Plus, any future revenues will go towards the funding and maintenance of Joia. Youâ€™ll be supporting open source software and getting a great service!

#### Vercel

To deploy on Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Create a project by clicking on **Add New... > Project**.
2. Select **Import Third-Party Git Repository** and enter the URL of this repository.
3. Insert the environment variables. To do so, use `.env.example` as a reference for the variables to fill in. You'll need to set the `DATABASE_URL` variable to point to your Postgres database, which you can provision with Vercel.
4. Deploy the project.
5. Set up your domain to point to the Vercel deployment.

#### Fully self-hosted

To self host a Joia app you'll need to follow the next steps:

1. Provision a Postgres database. The details may vary based on your stup.
2. Clone or copy this repository.
3. Create an `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file. You'll need to set the `DATABASE_URL` variable to point to your Postgres database.
4. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Build the NextJS app by running `npm run production:build`. This will prepare NextJS to be built and run the build itself.
6. Run a post-install script by running `npm run production:postbuild`. This script will run the migrations.
7. Bootstrap the app by running `npm run production:start`.
